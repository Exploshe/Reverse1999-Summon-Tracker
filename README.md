made this cause mobilemeta.gg's summon tracker is wrong and out of date, ty to them for the link getting method tho

https://exploshe.github.io/Reverse1999-Summon-Tracker/

still missing a lot of features but its usable

copying paimon.moe's look for now cause i like it better than hsr's but i want to have a unique reverse1999 look but im not creative enough to cook up a whole new design on my own

please share this if you find it useful :)
